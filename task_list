 * refactor to call *_short as *_inline and *_large as *_extended types
 * refactor text and blob iterators to extended_byte iterators
 * internally jsonb and tuple_list will be same as blob_extended types

 * NUMERIC
  * need a read/write iterator to read/write digits in order first from prefix then from the worm
  * api will read/write digits in to a buffer holding digits in a array of uint64_t[], each digit is a base 10^12 number

  * we also need a materialized struct to store all the digits (base 10^12)
    * struct stores uint sign_bits:2, int64_t exponent, and then a value array list of uint64_t digits
    * add functions like push least significant digit, add most significant digit (also changes exponent) and modify/get nth digit
    * write a complete briefcase of functions to perform add, sub, multiplication and division, compare and min, max functions

* TUPLE_LIST
  * list of tuple of homogeneous types stored one after the another like in a large_text or large_blob
  * need a function in tuple_def to get the size of a tuple from reading the prefix of object into a stream
    api something like uin32_t get_tuple_size_from_stream_using_tuple_def(tuple_def* tpl_d, void* buffer, uint32_t* buffer_size, void* context, uint32_t read_from_stream(void* context_p, void* data, uint32_t data_size));
    here the buffer must atleast be 4 bytes long and buffer_size will be set to the number of bytes read from the stream
  * once size is known we can skip or read the res to the bytes, making us point to the next tuple in the tuple_list

* JSONB
  * get -> takes var array of integers and string and makes you point to the beginning of the data in json struct
  * build a one direction readabale json serialization type, where we only need to go forward until we reach the desired type
  * create_worm
  * uses JSONparser's node as input object

 * Implement the below functions as templated macros, so their usage is common between all of text, blob, numeric and json
  * hash -> first hash the prefix as is, then hash all the bytes from the following worm
  * using the corresponding read write iterators
    * compare -> read iterators on both a and b -> compare until the 1st one vanishes -> return a - b -> for heap table
    * generate_prefix -> read iterator on the larger one and write on the shorter one -> to be used for indexes -> 1 if a is prefix of b, 2 if they are equal, 0 otherwise
    * is_prefix -> read on both on them, until the shorter one is completely read -> checking for indexes
