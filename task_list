PICKED TASKS

* define struct jsonb in-memory representation object using bst and array using arraylist, also an enum of jsonb type
  * number using materialized_numeric and strings and keys using dstring
* intiialize jsonb write_iterator to write the jsonb struct using the underlying binary_write_iterator

* define a container to store all json b accessor and their corresponding binary_read_iterator to start parsing from
* need a function to normalize all jsonb accessors, sorting them, removing duplicates, removing all accessors that are contained inside th another one
* need a function to iterate over all of jsonb_extended and build binary iterators to parse each one

* JSONB
  * first byte says type
    0 -> NULL
    1 -> true
    2 -> false
    3 -> string -> 4 byte size (>= 4), and then the bytes
    4 -> numeric -> 4 byte size (always 4 + 4*Ndigits + 3), 1 byte sign bits, 2 bytes exponent, then digits
    5 -> json array -> 4 byte size (>= 8), 4 byte element count, then elements
    6 -> json object -> 4 byte size (>= 8), 4 byte element count (always a multiple of 2, key then values), then keys and values alternatively, keys are always strings and ordered lexicographically
  * uses JSONparser's node as input object
    * build a helper function to serialize json_node and write it to a open binary_write_iterator
  * allows opening a binary_read_iterator on it using a json_accessor (from JSONparser library), which is first sorted and then elements with are prefixes to some other json_accessor, then some other are eliminated
   * we will allow partial parsing
   * function to check if the current object being pointed to is of what type using the first byte
   * generates text_reader_interface and numeric_reader_interface on text and numeric types
   * allows materializing the current object being pointer to into a json_node
   * json_node then allows equality, contains, union, intersection and difference
  * add hasher to hash some attribute nestedly


(*future)
materialized_numeric
  * write a complete briefcase of functions to perform add, sub, multiplication and division
