PICKED TASKS

* NUMERIC
  * in numeric add logic to define BYTES_PER_DIGIT macro and a meachanism that fails compilation if this value exceeds 8
  * implement digit_write_iterator -> write function
  * test digit_read_iterator and digit_write_iterator

------------------------

MATERIALIZED NUMERIC
  * we also need a materialized struct to store all the digits (base 10^12)
    * struct stores uint sign_bits:2, int64_t exponent, and then a value array list of uint64_t digits
    * add functions like push least significant digit, add most significant digit (also changes exponent) and modify/get nth digit
    * write a complete briefcase of functions to perform add, sub, multiplication and division, compare and min, max functions

* TUPLE_LIST
  * list of tuple of homogeneous types stored one after the another like in blob_extended -> no inline version for this, inline array is already supported by a native array of TupleStore
  * only inline versions of the types can be contained here (can not be composed of any extended type)
  * once size is known (using get_tuple_size_from_stream) we can skip or read the tuple to the buffer, making us point to the next tuple in the tuple_list
  * will use binary iterators underneath, because of structural similarity with blob_inline and blob_extended
  * implement a wrapper function over the read_from_binary_read_iterator to read tuples one after the another, by deciphering the size before hand and allocating the necessary buffers to hold all of the tuple

* JSONB
  * get -> takes var array of integers and string and makes you point to the beginning of the data in json struct
  * build a one direction readabale json serialization type, where we only need to go forward until we reach the desired type
  * create_worm
  * uses JSONparser's node as input object
  * will use binary iterators underneath, because of structural similarity with blob_inline and blob_extended

 * Implement the below functions as templated macros, so their usage is common between all of text, blob, numeric and json
  * hash -> first hash the prefix as is, then hash all the bytes from the following worm
  * using the corresponding read write iterators
    * compare -> read iterators on both a and b -> compare until the 1st one vanishes -> return a - b -> for heap table
    * generate_prefix -> read iterator on the larger one and write on the shorter one -> to be used for indexes -> 1 if a is prefix of b, 2 if they are equal, 0 otherwise
    * is_prefix -> read on both on them, until the shorter one is completely read -> checking for indexes
